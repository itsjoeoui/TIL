## Dream Big
The real joy isn't just in reaching your goals, but in enabling others to do the same.

## Brick Walls
The "brick walls" are there for a reason. They test how badly you want something, and they stop the people who don't care enough.

## Feedback
If no one points out your mistake, that's a really really bad sign. It means they have given up on you. Honest feedback is precious.
